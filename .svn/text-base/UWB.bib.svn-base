	of electromagnetic-wave propagation from a time-domain perspective,
	has given birth to a fascinating new technology, which today is commonly
	referred to as ultra-wideband (UWB). It has now been slightly more
	than 25 years since the 1978 seminal paper of Bennett and Ross, which
	summarized UWB's early applications. It thus seems appropriate, given
	the tremendous increase in interest in the technology since the Federal
	Communications Commission modified its Part 15 rules to accommodate
	UWB transmissions, to take a look at more recent system applications
	of this unique technology. This paper provides a brief historical
	perspective of UWB, discusses recent techniques for the generation
	and reception of short-pulse electromagnetic waveforms, and examines
	a number of recently developed UWB systems in the communications,
	radar, and precision-positioning fields. Finally, a brief assessment

	The transmission performance for vertical and horizontal polarizations

	types of UWB antennas are studied, namely an omnidirectional monopole

	antenna. From the study, it is found that the omnidirectional antenna
	experiences an increase in the transmission due to the reflections

	a higher attenuation as the body turns away from the transmit antenna
	compared to the directional antenna. However, the directional antenna
	is less sensitive to the distance of the antenna away from the body

	able to maintain high peak-to-peak amplitudes in the waveforms of

	IR-UWB transceiver has been designed for operation over the frequency
	range 3.1-4.1 GHz and implemented in 0.35-?m SiGe BiCMOS technology.
	The performance of two different algorithms, namely, the threshold-crossing
	and the maximum selection (MAX) algorithms, are compared in terms
	of TOA estimation error in Saleh Valenzuela channel model 3 and channel
	model 4. The implemented structure of the TOA MAX algorithm suitable
	for IR-UWB-based noncoherent receivers is presented. A UWB testbed
	has been constructed in order to test and measure the transmitted
	waveform as well the receiver performances. The simulated receiver
	noise figure is 7.3 dB while the receiver gain is 34 dB. The TOA
	MAX algorithm can achieve ±5-ns positioning accuracy for 95% of cases.
	Constant transconductance tuning circuits for improved TOA estimation
	reliability are also presented.},

	are employed to reach ultra-low power consumption. The analog front-end

	is proposed for low-power ultra-wideband pulse generation, shaping
	and modulation. It time-interleaves multiple impulse generators,
	and uses distributed circuit techniques to combine generated wideband
	impulses. Built-in pulse shaping can be realized by programming the
	delay and amplitude of each impulse similar to an FIR filter. Pulse
	modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse position
	modulation (PPM) can be easily applied in this architecture. Two
	DWG circuit prototypes were implemented in a standard 0.18 mum digital
	CMOS technology to demonstrate its advantages. A 10-tap, 10 GSample/s,
	single-polarity DWG prototype achieves a pulse rate of 1 GHz while

	data. A 10-tap, 10 GSample/s, dual-polarity DWG prototype was developed
	to generate UWB pulses compliant with the transmit power emission
	mask. Based on the latter DWG design, a reconfigurable impulse radio
	UWB (IR-UWB) transmitter prototype was implemented. The transmitter's

	of generated UWB pulses is also variable, and was measured up to
	6 GHz (- 10 dB bandwidth). Both OOK and PPM modulation schemes are
	successfully demonstrated using 32 Mb/s PRBS data. The IR-UWB transmitter
	achieves a measured energy efficiency of 45 pJ/pulse, independent
